## Details

- Ability to add/remove products and change their amounts in cart - on the cart page itself, PLP and PDP should be provided.
- For products that have various options (attributes) - the options should be selected.
- The selected options of added to cart products should be visible in cart overlay and in cart page.
- If an attribute is a swatch attribute (type = swatch), a representation of the value should be rendered on PDP and PLP, rather than text description (e.g. the color itself, not "Blue" or "0000FF")
- Filtering products by category name for all of the categories from BE
- The descriptions provided in HTML format should be parsed and presented as HTML, not as plain text
